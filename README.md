# Tomato_Disease_Prediction

Tomato Disease Prediction using Deep Learning applies AI and computer vision to identify and predict diseases in tomato plants through image analysis.
It enables early disease detection, minimizing crop losses, reducing costs, and promoting sustainable farming practices.
Future work: The technology can be deployed as a user-friendly mobile or web application for easy access by farmers in the field.
